Hiring Manager
Whitman, Requardt & Associates, LLP
801 S. Caroline Street
Baltimore, MD 21231
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in the Water Resources Engineer position at Whitman, Requardt 
& Associates’ Baltimore office. As a licensed Maryland Professional Engineer with a master’s 
degree in Water Resources Engineering and over 15 years of progressive experience supporting 
public infrastructure throughout the region, I am excited by the opportunity to join a team that 
blends technical excellence with a people-focused culture.
During my tenure at RK&K, I led and supported a wide range of stormwater and environmental 
projects. I managed drainage design for the I-95 Widening at MD 152 in Harford County, 
coordinating a three-person team and designing bioretention, outfalls, and crossings around 
sensitive constraints including a 108-inch transmission main. As the sole designer of the Spangler 
Lane Pond retrofit for the City of Bowie, I completed full grading, hydraulic, and permitting design 
for a WQv-compliant MS4 facility serving 110 acres. For the Willow Pond restoration in Carroll 
County, I led phased erosion and sediment control design to safely manage 2-year flows through a 
1,700-foot stream and floodplain retrofit. Additional projects include outfall stabilization in Prince 
George’s County, trenchless culvert rehab in Montgomery County, and screening support for SHA’s 
MS4 retrofit program.
My technical proficiencies include TR-55, TR-20, HY-8, FlowMaster, OpenRoads Designer, Civil 
3D, HEC-RAS, MicroStation, and ArcGIS. I’ve trained junior staff on many of these platforms and 
co-authored Baltimore City’s updated ESD design manual. I also bring programming experience in 
Excel VBA and Python, developed through my graduate thesis modeling urban sedimentation with 
stochastic rainfall generators and TR-20 hydrographs. These skills later enabled me to build 
automated workflows and tools for engineering clients, which I now apply to enhance design 
efficiency and technical quality. I’m currently completing PMP coursework to strengthen my ability  
to manage project delivery and mentor team members.
WRA’s commitment to high-quality engineering and long-term professional growth deeply aligns 
with my values. I am particularly drawn to your multidisciplinary approach, public and private 
sector presence, and legacy of regional leadership. I would be honored to bring my skills and 
experience to your Water Resources team in Baltimore.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Justin Gupta, PE
